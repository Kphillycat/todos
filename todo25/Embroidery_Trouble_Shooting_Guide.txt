Answers:
The text is getting progressively larger as you go down the page. It's all <h3s> with text size to 1.17em. Em is used to scale based on current size of the font.
- Uses inline-styling with nested <h3> which increases the font-size by 1.17em. If you have one <h3> then all the others will inherit from.
- Styling using HTML attributes
- Not semantic tags. Doesn't describe the value of the content.
- Use of old <font>, <center> and tables tags
- Was made with Microsoft FrontPage 5.0,
- HTML 3.2
- Could use the CSS reset to override the browser stylesheet. http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
